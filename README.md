# JavaScript Techdegree Project 1: Quote Generator

This project is about creating an app that displays random famous quotes, that are stored in an object array, each time a button is clicked.

I added the following functionality:

* Optional property 'category' that is displayed if it exists
* Quotes change automatically after 10 seconds (button isn't clicked)
* A quote won't be displayed twice consecutively
* Background color is randomly changed (\<body\> and \<button>\)
