# JavaScript Techdegree Project #1: A random quote generator

## Description

Using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS I created an app that displays a random quote every time a button is pressed or after an interval of 10 seconds if the button isn't clicked. Some quotes have additional properties, like categorization tags and year. The same quote won't be displayed twice consecutively and the background color is randomly changed when the quote changes - the hue is randomized whereas the brightness and saturation are constant to make sure that the quote is always easily readable.

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://rliess.github.io/quote-generator/).
