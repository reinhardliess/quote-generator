# JavaScript Techdegree Project #1: A random quote generator

## Description

This project is about creating an app that displays random famous quotes, that are stored in an object array, each time a button is clicked.

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://rliess.github.io/quote-generator/).

### Additional Remarks

- The optional property 'category' is displayed if it exists
- Quotes change automatically after 10 seconds if the button isn't clicked
- A quote won't be displayed twice consecutively
- Background color is randomly changed (\<body\> and \<button>\) - the hue is randomized keeping the brightness and saturation of the chosen background color (#36b55C, HSL: 138, 54, 46) constant to improve readability.
